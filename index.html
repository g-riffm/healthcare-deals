  <td class="notes">This is a neurology practice focused on neurotherapies and sleep treatments rather than behavioral/mental health services. Located in DC area which doesn't match California/Kentucky preference. Financial metrics show reasonable cash flow margin (48% SDE margin) but the specialty focus is outside the buyer's core interest areas of psychiatry, therapy, and behavioral health.</td>

  <td class="notes">Practice meets industry and price requirements with solid revenue base and insurance relationships. However, New Jersey location conflicts with buyer's California/Kentucky preference. SDE margin of 35% appears reasonable but lacking EBITDA transparency raises concerns. Expansion opportunities mentioned but no specifics on current provider structure or management requirements.</td>
